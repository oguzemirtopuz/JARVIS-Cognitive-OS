    What's New (v2):
    ──────────────────────────────── ─────────────────────────────────
    [4] VISION “CONTINUOUS ANALYSIS” — Dynamic Range System:
        + Automatic accelerating/decelerating cycle as needed instead of fixed 5 minutes
        + The interval is shortened when a change is detected on the screen (quick observation)
        + The interval is extended when the screen remains stable (resource saving)
        + Min/max range limits are maintained for safety

    [5] PROACTIVE BEHAVIOR CALIBRATION:
        + Talk/silence threshold finely adjusted
        + Proactivity level varies depending on time zone
        + Consecutive silence counter: shares observation even if silenced for too long
        + Strict rules to prevent unnecessary chatter

    Available (protected):
    + Vision result is sent to GUI as a card
    + Summary card added to Mission Control when proactive action occurs
    + HUD visual status is updated via Vision status callback"""
