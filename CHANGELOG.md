## [v16.5.0] - 2026-06-02
### Added
- **[UI/System] Settings Module & Auto-Start:** Integrated a dedicated SETTINGS tab into the HUD. Features include dynamic Screen Analysis Interval selection, one-click Windows Auto-Start registration (`winreg`), and a synchronized Language Switcher.
- **[System] Dynamic Screen Analysis:** Upgraded the `ProactiveWatcher` to accept user-defined intervals directly from the new Settings Module. Automatically pauses operations when disabled, saving API tokens.
- **[Commands] Slash Shortcuts:** Added direct slash commands (`/analysis 5`, `/analiz kapat`, etc.) to instantly control the watcher interval from the text interface.

### Fixed
- **[Core] Google GenAI Migration:** Upgraded the legacy `google.generativeai` imports to the new `google.genai` SDK and adapted prompting logic for the `gemini-2.5-flash` model inside `audio/stt.py`.
- **[UI] Scrollbar Aesthetics:** Replaced legacy TKinter scrollbars with elegant `ctk.CTkScrollbar` components matching the J.A.R.V.I.S. dark blue theme.
- **[Stability] State Transition Logic:** Patched an invalid state transition warning in `core/state_manager.py` that occurred when a task tried transitioning to its already active state.

---

## [v16.4.0] - 2026-05-30
### Added
- **[System] Bilingual Input Core:** J.A.R.V.I.S. now seamlessly understands and processes both English and Turkish voice commands regardless of the active UI mode. TTS responses are strictly enforced in English to prevent audio distortion.
- **[Core] Autonomous Bug Squashing:** Added extensive Turkish language detection in system logging loops for proper user/jarvis text color tagging on the HUD.

### Fixed
- **[Stability] Brain Asyncio Race Condition:** Fixed a critical flaw where `_lock` lazy-loading allowed two threads to override the LLM execution lock, breaking mutual exclusion.
- **[Stability] Event Loop Blocking:** Moved `locale.setlocale` out of the asynchronous `think()` block to prevent synchronous event loop freezing.
- **[UI] GUI State & Layout:** Restored invisible scrollbars in the Log panel, patched memory counters that failed to translate dynamically, and fixed `TEXT MODE` detection logic.
- **[Watcher] Dead Code:** Cleaned up unused `JarvisVision` initializations and dead interval parameters from the `ProactiveWatcher`.

---

## [v16.3.0] - 2026-05-30
### Added
- **[System] STT Initialization Logs:** Translated the Groq Whisper & Fallback Google Web Speech API initialization logs to English to ensure a fully unified English system/console experience.
- **[UI/System] Global Translation:** Translated all major UI elements (HAFIZA to MEMORY, YAZILI MOD to TEXT MODE, KAPATILIYOR to SHUTTING DOWN), system logs, comments, and debug messages to English across the core system.

### Fixed
- **[Stability] Proactive Watcher Idle Fix:** Fixed a critical bug where the Proactive Watcher would mistakenly assume the user wanted to shut down J.A.R.V.I.S. after exactly 15 minutes of inactivity. Added a strict calibration rule forbidding the `SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN` and `SYSTEM_POWER` protocols during background proactive cycles.
- **[Core] System Tool Restoration:** Restored `system_tool.py` ensuring that all tool classes (StressTestTool through YouTubeStrategyTool) are fully operational.

---

## [v16.2.0]
### Added
- **[Installer] 1-Click System Setup (`install.bat`):** Added a new, fully automated 7-step installer for Windows systems. Sets up Python `venv`, fetches FFmpeg, manages configs, and places a desktop shortcut.

### Fixed
- **[Optimizations] Memory Leak Fix:** Addressed a critical memory leak in `SemanticRouter` during TF-IDF vector pruning.
- **[Optimizations] Semantic Routing Threshold:** Expanded confidence routing; scores between `0.30 <= score < 0.65` now match with `is_forced=False`, keeping local matching speed while leaving final validation to the cognitive LLM.

---

## [v16.1.0] - The Architect Update
### Added
- **[Security] Un-bypassable AST Sandbox:** Enhanced AST validation of `DynamicSkillSynthesizer` to block all potential sandbox escape vectors. Direct built-in manipulation (`__import__`, `getattr`, `setattr`, `globals`, `locals`, `compile`) and dunder attributes (`__builtins__`, `__dict__`, `__class__`, etc.) are now strictly blocked. Validation runs entirely asynchronous in a thread pool to avoid blocking the event loop.
- **Async LRU & FFmpeg Integration:** Refactored caching to support async flows and integrated FFmpeg properly for local audio operations.
- **Code Freeze:** Formalized core OS stability with strict checks and silent exception swallowing prevention.

---

## [v16.0.0]
### Added
- **[Dynamic Skill Synthesizer]:** Autonomously writes its own asynchronous Python tools on the fly, applies AST security checks, and hot-loads them into the registry.

---

## [v15.4.0]
### Added
- **[Cognitive OS Evolution]:** TTS cache, sandbox input block, reflection self-healing engine, and dynamic config updates.
- **[Memory Protocols]:** Added `REMEMBER` and `STARTUP_REMINDER` protocols for true episodic memory creation.

---

## [v15.0.0]
### Added
- **[Self-Learning Loop]:** Implemented autonomous self-learning loop with dynamic embedding cache.
- **[Semantic Router]:** Implemented zero-latency vector-based semantic router, replacing the legacy regex engine.

---

## [v13.2.0]
### Added
- **[Ghost Shield]:** Implemented Ghost Shield to prevent Whisper hallucinations and low-energy speech processing.
- **[Updater]:** Added one-click auto-updater (`update.py`) — no Git required, protects personal data.
