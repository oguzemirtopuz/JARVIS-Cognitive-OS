> **The Era of Simple Chatbots is Over. Welcome to True Autonomy.**

**J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System)** is an elite, state-of-the-art **Cognitive AI Operating System** designed to bridge the gap between static LLM chatbots and fully autonomous, self-healing digital entities. Built on a non-blocking asynchronous architecture, J.A.R.V.I.S. autonomously navigates web browsers, manipulates desktop environments, synthesizes new skills on the fly, and reflects on its own failures to learn and adapt.

## 🛑 The Core Problem: Why Chatbots Fail

Traditional chatbots act as passive responders—they wait for prompts and output raw text. They lack context, persistence, and agency. When they encounter an error (like a website structure changing), they crash and require human intervention. 

**J.A.R.V.I.S. Solves This:** By shifting from a conversational model to an **LLM Orchestration Framework**, J.A.R.V.I.S. acts independently. It breaks down high-level objectives into actionable sub-tasks, delegates them to stateless tools, and continuously monitors execution state.

```

### 🧠 LLM Orchestration & Dynamic Tree Planning
The execution pipeline is not sequential; it is dynamic. High-level directives are parsed by the orchestration layer into a strict hierarchical tree of `PlanNode` objects. This allows the OS to tackle multi-step operations efficiently, routing complex tasks to the LLM and simpler tasks directly to local semantic routers in milliseconds.

### 🪞 The Reflection Engine (Self-Healing System)
Errors are no longer dead ends. When a sub-task fails (e.g., an API timeout or UI change), J.A.R.V.I.S. triggers the **Reflection Engine**:
1. It halts the asynchronous task queue.
2. It analyzes the error logs and environment context autonomously.
3. It generates a **completely new sub-plan** to bypass the hurdle.
4. Execution resumes along the new path with zero human intervention required.

### 💾 Cognitive Memory Subsystems
J.A.R.V.I.S. possesses true episodic memory:
*   **Episodic Recall:** Every success and failure is embedded in a local Vector Database. The system autonomously recalls past solutions when facing similar future obstacles.
*   **Self-Learning Router:** Automatically prunes obsolete vectors using LFU/LRU caching to maintain absolute efficiency, operating within a secure local-first environment without ever leaking personal data.

---

## 💎 Value Proposition

*   **Absolute Autonomy:** No more hand-holding. Set the objective and let the OS figure out the execution tree.
*   **Infinite Modularity (Dynamic Skill Synthesizer):** If J.A.R.V.I.S. encounters an unknown tool requirement, it uses the LLM to write its own asynchronous Python tools on the fly, applies strict AST-sandbox security checks, and hot-loads them into the registry.
*   **Zero-Latency Fallbacks:** The machine learning-based Semantic Router handles standard commands instantly. The LLM is invoked **only** for complex cognitive benchmarks, optimizing both speed and API costs.
*   **Ironclad Security:** Un-bypassable AST validation prevents LLM-generated code from escaping the sandbox. Dunder attributes and critical system commands are instantly blocked.

## ✨ Latest Enhancements (v16.5.0)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Complete Control: Settings HUD, Auto-Start & GenAI Migration**
> * **[System/UI] Unified Settings Hub:** Deployed a highly requested SETTINGS tab directly into the UI. Users can now natively toggle Windows Auto-Start (`winreg` integrated), dynamically control the Proactive Watcher's observation interval, and switch global language profiles in real-time.
> * **[Commands] Dynamic Slash Commands:** The OS now natively intercepts `/analysis off` or `/analiz 5` slash commands through the text terminal, immediately updating backend behavior and UI state.
> * **[Core] Google GenAI SDK Upgrade:** Entirely deprecated `google.generativeai` in favor of the latest `google.genai` client, upgrading core models to `gemini-2.5-flash` for whisper-fast audio and visual reasoning.

*(For a full list of past version histories including v16.4.0, refer to the Changelog section in the codebase.)*

## 🔒 Security and Privacy Policy

J.A.R.V.I.S. operates fully under a **secure local-first** principle:
*   **Local Memory Database:** Memory and semantic experience logs are stored in your local `memory_db/` directory, never sent to external servers.
*   **Sensitive Data Protection (`.gitignore`):** `.env` (API Keys), `contacts.json` (Personal contacts), and local log/error files are protected by an optimized Git exclude list.
